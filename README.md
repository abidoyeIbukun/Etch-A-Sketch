### Etch-A-Sketch
A very intresting project that has a very good interface with very good option of 'button colors' to chose from and it provide you with power to create 
your own grid board.
### What I've learned
This project provide me with good opportunity to practice more on DOM, it also help me understand more about using loop to create the grid board and on how 
to make some things work in a function.
### Built with:
HTML, CSS and javaScript.
